Social network analysis on a dataset about Harry Potter characters.

## Dataset

The dataset contains characters from the Harry Potter series and the relations between them (friendly or hostile).

## Analysis

<p>
The social influencers of the network are found through an attempt to compute a <i>minimum vertex cover</i>.
<br>
In addition, possible conflicts are anticipated through an attempt to compute the <i>structural imbalance</i> of the
network.
</p>
These problems are solved via Quantum Annealing.
